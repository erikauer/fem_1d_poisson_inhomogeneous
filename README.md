# fem_1d_poisson_inhomogeneous
Basic Matlab example of solving the 1 dimensional poisson equation with inhomogenous dirichlet boundary conditions with FEM (=Finite element method).

## Introduction
This repository is a fork of https://github.com/erikauer/fem_1d_poisson which consider the poisson equation for homogenous dirichlet boundary conditions.

## Get sources

     git clone https://github.com/erikauer/fem_1d_poisson.git

### Run FEM Method in Matlab
Just go inside the project root directory and run the main.m script by enter

     main
 
in Matlab Command Window.
